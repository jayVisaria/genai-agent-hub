### Agent Architecture

The Stock Analysis Agent uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture:

- **Stock Analysis Coordinator**: The root agent that orchestrates the entire analysis process by delegating tasks to the Analysis Orchestrator.
- **Analysis Orchestrator**: Coordinates all specialized sub-agents and synthesizes their outputs into a comprehensive investment report.
- **Sub-Agents**: Each sub-agent is responsible for a specific domain of analysis (technical, fundamental, sentiment, qualitative, risk).

    B --> G[Risk Assessment Agent]
```

## Tools and APIs Used

Each sub-agent leverages specific tools to perform its analysis:

| Sub-Agent                | Tools Used         | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Fundamental Agent        | Google Search     | Retrieves financial statements, earnings, and company news for analysis. |
| Technical Agent          | Google Search     | Gathers price data, charts, and technical indicators. |
| Sentiment Agent          | Google Search     | Collects news, analyst opinions, and social sentiment. |
| Qualitative Agent        | Google Search     | Finds information on management, business model, and competitive landscape. |
| Risk Assessment Agent    | Google Search     | Identifies and quantifies risk factors from market and company data. |
| Analysis Orchestrator    | AgentTool         | Synthesizes outputs from all sub-agents. |
| Stock Analysis Coordinator | AgentTool       | Orchestrates the overall workflow. |

All sub-agents use the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` model for LLM-based reasoning.
