# Slack AI Support Agent â€“ n8n Workflow

This n8n workflow integrates Slack, Zendesk, and a company knowledge base (via Milvus) to provide an intelligent AI-powered support agent for Slack channels. It leverages Google Gemini for LLM and embeddings, and follows a structured support and escalation process.

## Features

- **Slack Integration:** Listens for `@app_mention` events in a specified Slack channel and responds with AI-generated support answers.
- **Knowledge Base Search:** Uses Milvus vector store and Gemini embeddings to search the company knowledge base for relevant solutions before troubleshooting.
- **AI-Powered Responses:** Utilizes Google Gemini LLM to analyze user queries, conversation context, and knowledge base results to generate helpful, context-aware responses.
- **Zendesk Integration:**
  - **Create Ticket:** Escalates to Zendesk only after troubleshooting steps are exhausted or upon explicit user request.
  - **Get Recent Tickets:** Retrieves the latest Zendesk tickets for user status queries.
  - **Get Ticket by ID:** Fetches details for a specific Zendesk ticket when requested.
- **Conversation Memory:** Maintains context across user interactions for more coherent and helpful support.
