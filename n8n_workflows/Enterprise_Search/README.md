# Enterprise Search Assistant â€“ n8n Workflow

This n8n workflow provides an AI-powered Enterprise Search Assistant specialized in Jira ticket analysis and enterprise knowledge retrieval. It is designed to help users find accurate information from Jira and deliver actionable insights, but can be easily extended to include other enterprise data sources such as SharePoint, Confluence, or custom databases.

## Extending the Workflow

This workflow is designed to be extensible. You can add more connectors to search across other enterprise data sources, such as:

- **SharePoint:** Integrate with SharePoint to search documents, sites, and lists.
- **Confluence:** Add Confluence integration for wiki and documentation search.
- **Databases:** Connect to SQL/NoSQL databases for structured data retrieval.
- **Custom APIs:** Integrate any RESTful API for additional data sources.

To extend, simply add new nodes for your data source, connect them to the AI Agent, and update the system prompt to describe the new capabilities.

## Example Use Cases

- Find all high-priority bugs in a specific Jira project.
- List all tickets assigned to the current user.
- Analyze recent activity or trends in project issues.
- Retrieve documentation or files from SharePoint (with connector added).

## Best Practices

- Keep your Jira and other data source credentials secure and up to date.
- Regularly review and refine the AI Agent's system prompt for optimal results.
